# Credit-Card-Default-Detection



https://cred-default-detector.herokuapp.com


Used Flask , docker image and deployed on Heroku platform


### Introduction
Whenever we accept a credit card, we agree to certain terms and conditions including making our repayments by the due date listed on our credit card statement. When we miss the minimum payment by 6 months or more in a row, our credit card will be in default. In such situations, our credit card issuer will first send several notices via email or SMS and call us asking to make the repayment. If we do not make the payment after a stipulated period, they will close our account and report the default to the credit bureaus. This period may vary from one credit card provider to another. This tends to impact our credit score and it will be difficult for us to get approved for loans in the future. Once we are listed as a credit card defaulter, we become a risk for any credit obligation. 

### Goal
   The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer would commit a credit card default or not. It also aims to integrate the model and build a docker image for deployment on the Heroku Platform.
